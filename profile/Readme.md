DunoLabs' mission is to develop open-source micro-saas applications using various technologies to help businesses & individuals. 
</br>
we cover all the aspects by providing a wonderful cross-platform user experience. 

**About us**
---
Founded in April 2022, DunoLabs' plan is to develop micro-saas applications across multiple domains. DunoLabs teams up a community of experts to develop open-source software that enables users to accomplish tasks quickly and easily. The main goal is to provide a phenomenal user experience.

**What do we do?**
---
DunoLabs is a community of passionate developers, designers, & community members who are continuously developing micro-saas applications. while software companies are working hard to achieve product-led growth, our pragmatic vision is to ensure that software products have great product adoption. We believe that the best software products are built by people who are passionate about what they do.

Also we are not just building open-source micro-saas applications but we are also building a family of our users who can trust us, who can get benefit from our work, and who can help us grow.

**Contribution / How to Get Involved**
---
We are open to collaboration and we are always looking for new ideas to improve our products, we share our code here on Github, and if you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.

We love open source and we understand the power of collaboration. We learned a lot from the open-source community and now it's time to give something back to the community and to the world.

Contributions are accepted at all stages of open source development.
